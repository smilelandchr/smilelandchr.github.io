川普一直在强调此次COVID-2019是中国病毒，实际上讨论病毒发源地在科学研究上有意义，但在政治上是无意义的，病毒爆发是一个自然现象，发源地无需对它负责，疯牛病发源于英国，需要英国负责么？艾滋病发源于美国，需要美国负责么？相反的第一个爆发地区受到的伤害是最大的，因为之前并不会有对病毒爆发的预警，应该受到同情才对。

Trump has been emphasizing that the COVID-2019 is a Chinese virus. In fact, discussing the origin of the virus is scientifically meaningful, but it is politically meaningless. The virus outbreak is a natural phenomenon and the origin is not responsible for it.  BSE originates in the UK. Does the UK need to be responsible?  AIDS originates in the United States. Does the United States need to be responsible?  On the contrary, the first outbreak area suffered the most, because there was no previous warning of the virus outbreak, and it should be sympathized.
